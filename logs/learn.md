This document is tagged in [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) best viewed in a suitable interpreter.

##Things to Learn

-[Connect sessions](http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/middleware-session.html) the basis for all client interactions

-[Connect cookieParser](http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/middleware-cookieParser.html) for storing data client-site

-[Node MySQL](https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql) so we can interact with *legacy* Databases
