I decided to move the the site from Drupal (PHP/MySQL/Apache) to NodeJS+ Express/Connect/MongoDB.
Partly because its 'The New-New-Thing' but mostly just to make a clean break from the past mess!

I'm using GitHub as our code repo to simplify transfering work from dev to prod servers.
This ticks several boxes:
[x] Code is stored in a Version Control System (and remotely backed up)
[x] Changes can be easily/rapidly tested/deployed (and rolled back)
[x] Code is Open Source by Default (rather than a PR/Afterthought)
[x] Our Pipeline and Issue tracking is Open & Transparent


The downside is other people can see all our bugs.
The upside   is other people can see all our bugs... :-)

Hopefully it will make asking questions on Stack/GitHub easier as 
we can just point to the exact file/LOC.

Showing all the code as I write it means people can see how the app progresses 
and how everything fits together.
And if anyone wants to complain/suggest/contribute they can check out the existing code, 
load the dummy data and try to do it better! :-)

Lets get started.
